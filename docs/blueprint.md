## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Strong blue (#2962FF) to convey trust, reliability and professionalism. This also hints at Sri Lanka's flag (but tastefully).
- Background color: Light-blue gray (#E5E9F2) to reduce eye strain and create a clean backdrop.
- Accent color: Orange (#FF9100), used for CTAs and highlights to draw the user's attention to key interactive elements and provide contrast.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif to provide a modern look while still ensuring approachability. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Simple, geometric icons for primary actions such as accepting jobs or toggling availability.  Icons should be designed with enough visual weight to compensate for a relative lack of graphical UI elements elsewhere.
- Emphasize large touch targets and clear button design with sufficient padding. Prioritize vertical stacking of content for easy, one-handed use.
- Subtle animations on state changes and loading transitions (e.g., toggling online/offline) to give feedback without being distracting.
